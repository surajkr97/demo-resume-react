            <p id="project-desc">A hand gesture-controlled robot car that can be controlled through the movement of the hand. we used a band that was worn on the hand and connected to the car via Bluetooth. The band had an accelerometer and gyroscope that detected the movement of the hand and sent signals to the car. This project required a lot of programming and calibration, but the end result was worth it. It was amazing to see the car move in response to the movement of the hand. </p>
